	    <h2>Cloud Integration Services</h2>
			<p>Hype aside, there are significant benefits cloud computing can offer an agency. From simplified cost and consumption to faster provisioning of systems and applications, scalable to any changes in demand.</p>
			<p>The cloud makes computing globally accessible in a simple, cost effective manner.  The key to successful cloud adoption is the comprehensive initial assessment we perform that encompasses every component of the IT process. With our structured approach, we help customers determine the most effective cloud deployment strategy.</p>
			<p>Since we do not represent any technology brand, we are able to provide unbiased recommendations for the best fitting COTS solution, or determine whether a custom cloud solution is most appropriate. The solution can be a customized private Cloud within your organization, managed either remotely or with your own infrastructure. Alternatively, the cloud can be a fully managed enterprise cloud, entirely off premises, delivered as either dedicated or multi-tenant.</p>
			<p>Regardless of your current setup, we can take you from legacy systems to a new cloud infrastructure. Our industry certified professional engineers analyze your needs, design tailor-made solutions, and provide seamless implementation.</p>
			<p>Increase efficiency, improve productivity, and reduce costs by building a next generation cloud infrastructure. With experience building enterprise virtual datacenters and enterprise clouds on VMWare Vcloud Director, OpenStack, Amazon Web Services, Terremark, and RackSpace platforms, nuvitek can deliver solutions for even the most complex projects.</p>
