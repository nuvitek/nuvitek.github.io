	      <h2>Case Study: Desktop Virtualization</h2>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>One of our Federal Customers datacenter was experiencing physical server sprawl with growing demand for additional server capacity to develop, test and deploy new applications. Adding new servers to meet this demand meant adding additional real estate, power and cooling to the datacenter. The time required to provision and deliver servers to the application team was significantly high which caused delays in several projects implementations.</p>

	    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<ul><li>Stop physical sprawl by server consolidation</li>
				<li>Meet business demands for more resources in a short timeframe</li>
				<li>Enable business continuity for critical applications</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Our Solution</h3>
			<p>VMware server virtualization enabled us to meet the requirements by virtualizing the datacenter through the installation, configuration and tuning of VMware vSphere and related technologies. To date, we have consolidated and virtualized about 500 servers running under VMware vSphere on 20 physical servers . A second virtualization cluster was implemented at a backup datacenter. The implementation automatically synchronized data and replicated virtual machines to the disaster recovery cluster, ensuring availability of applications in the event of a disaster.</p>

			<h3>Results</h3> Great Results Matter
			<ul><li>Stopped physical server sprawl and achieved 20:1 server consolidation ratio. </li>
				<li>Met business demands for more resources in a short time frame. </li>
				<li>Enabled a reliable business continuity and disaster recovery solution that took minutes to recover instead of hours. </li>
				<li>Significantly reduced power, cooling and datacenter space to support green IT initiative. </li>
				<li>Enabled remote management of the centralized, virtual server environment.</li>
			</ul>
